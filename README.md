## Hi there!

I like programming (and giraffes)! 🍍 - mainly in C/C++, like my [Chess Engine](https://github.com/tibifant/blunder), [Neural Network](https://github.com/tibifant/darwinwin), a bunch of little 2D / 3D Games & working on embedded platforms

### These are my three favourite personal projects:

🌳 **[DarWinWin](https://github.com/tibifant/darwinwin) - Ecosystem simulation with AI actors**<br/>
An ecosystem simulation where Neural Network based (SIMD forward pass) AI-actors evolve to survive. Through the means of natural selection of mutating genes (weights & biases) actors learned to move, eat, not drown, drag food to land, etc. in order to ~~not perish on contact~~ survive in cruel procedurally generated worlds.

♟ **[blunder](https://github.com/tibifant/blunder) - Simple Chess Engine in C++**<br/>
Blunder is a C++ Chess Engine based on the MiniMax Algorithm with Alpha-Beta Pruning, Iterative Deepening with Aspiration Windows, Quiescence Search and other fun tricks to obliterate ~~me~~ noobs at chess - it certainly won't beat Magnus Carlsen, though.

💬 **[linoplapp](https://github.com/tibifant/linoplapp) - Experimental text-to-speech processor**<br/>
Linoplapp explores the limits of a minimal text-to-speech Algorithm. Starting from the IPA-notation of an input phrase, it assembles matching pre-recorded voice snippets of IPA sequences into an output WAV-file - with some luck and good listening comprehension you might even be able to make out a couple of words 😉
